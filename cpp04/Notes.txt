Polymorphism
    Compile-time polymorphism:
        Function overloading and operator overloading.
    Run-time polymorphism:
        Using inheritance and virtual functions, allowing derived classes to override
        base class methods.
        Promotes flexibility and reusability in code by enabling one interface to be used for
        different underlying forms (data types)
        Without declaring a base class member function as virtual will cause 
        the program to run the base class member function despite having identical
        function in derived or not.

Virtual destructor
    Ensures the derived class destructor is called when deleting
    an object through a base class pointer. Without it, only only
    base destructor is called.

const
    Without putting the keyword the function unable to
    handle object that is declared as constant object.
