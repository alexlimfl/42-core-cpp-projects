Polymorphism
    Compile-time polymorphism:
        function overloading and operator overloading.
    Run-time polymorphism:
        using inheritance and virtual functions, allowing derived classes to override base class methods.
        promotes flexibility and reusability in code by enabling one interface to be used for different underlying forms (data types)
        Declaring a base class member function as virtual without override fucntion by derived class won't cause any problem.

const
    Without putting the keyword the function unable to
    handle object that is declared as constant object.
